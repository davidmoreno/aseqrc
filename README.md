# Alsa Sequencer Remote Control

Creates an http server that aallows to easily control alsa sequencer
connections.

I use it to connect all my MIDI gear to a Raspberry Pi, and control the
connections with my mobile.

Very handily it is packaged as a PWA, so it can be installed as an app from
the browser.

A deb package can be generated with `make deb`.
